# BM-UI-Enhancements

This mod requires [`Banana Mod Manager`](https://github.com/MorsGames/BananaModManager).

UI Enhancements adds a few minor HUD Tweaks and quality of life changes to Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania!

Current Features include:
 - Moving the Ranking Timer
 - Removing the yellow tint on the background, as well as the character portrait
 - Allowing music to run in the background while keeping the same game logic (Gameplay will still pause)

Feel free to add suggestions under Issues, or contribute directly with Pull Requests!
