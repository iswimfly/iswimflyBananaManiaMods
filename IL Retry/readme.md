# IL Retry Mod

This mod provides speedrunners with a quick tool to retry stages in modes you normally would not be able to. Every mode including practice mode now has the same retry button as practice mode. Requested by Dead Line!

Since this hooks into controller inputs and I couldn't be bothered to figure out rebinding, it's stuck to Y/â–³ on controller, or X on keyboard.
