Thanks for downloading my mod!

This mod replaces the ball color/texture/skin of the specified characters with the ball(s) of your choosing.
The character choices are listed as Sonic, Tails and Other.
Other refers to everyone other than the 6 core monkeys, Sonic and Tails (Jam, Jet, Kiryu, Beat, the DLC's).
Everyone in Other all shares the same ball, so this mod will replace that ball for everyone.

These numbers refer to the number of each ball in the Costumes menu. That Hat Guy was kind enough to compile a list of all the options:

0: Regular Ball (Red)
1: Black
2: Blue
3: Yellow
4: Green
5: Pink
6: Camo Green
7: Camo Brown

13: Paisley Blue
14: Gigham Check Black
15: Gigham Check Red
16: Gigham Check Yellow
17: Gigham Check Blue
18: Dotted Egg
19: Scroll
20: Leopard Print
21: Zebra Stripes
22: Geometric Lines
23: Stars
24: Banana
25: Soccer Ball
26: Basketball

31: Flowers [Preorder Exclusive]
