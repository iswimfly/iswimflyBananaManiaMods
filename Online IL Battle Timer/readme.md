# Online IL Battle Timer

This mod adds an Individual Level Battle Timer to Banana Mania, with an added UI Element for online battles!

It's virtually the same as the offline battle timer, but with the same window as the Bingo UI log. Requires BMOnline to work!

The keybinds are:
- Pressing `Backspace` enables and disables Perfect Clears as a clearing requirement
- Pressing `+` and `-` adds and subtracts a minute from the timer respectively, with a minimum of 1 minute and no set maximum.
- Pressing `LeftShift` starts a battle, and `Tab` stops the current battle.
- Holding `Control` and pressing `Enter` shows/hides the log.
- Holding `Control` and pressing `Backspace` clears the log.
