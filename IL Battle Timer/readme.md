# IL Battle Timer

This mod adds an Individual Level Battle Timer to Practice Mode!

The keybinds are:
- Pressing `Backspace` enables and disables Perfect Clears as a clearing requirement
- Pressing `-` and `+` adds and subtracts a minute from the timer, with a minimum of 1 minute and no set maximum.
- Pressing `LeftShift` starts a battle, and `Tab` stops the current battle.
